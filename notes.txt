Python is written in C

Monday
> Welcome and intros
> where to write code: module (just a file) or immediate python
> architecture, structure, and professional code best practice
> print() and input()
> maths operators and data types
> indentation
> immutable strings
> print formatting
> lists and tuples
- memory efficiency
- identifiers
> boolean True and False
> type and type conversion
> the if statement for conditional logic
> for, while, break and pass

  BIG files
> quick review of where we got to
> sys.path
> venv see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
> __init__.py - no longer needed (but is needed in Py2)
> sets
> range, generators
> comprehensions
> passing command-line arguments (which are ALWAYS strings)
> to add libraries to python:
  - python -m ensurepip
  - python â€“m pip install requests (or any other library you need)
> using requests (to access web API via HTTP)
> strings with triple quotes
> exception handling (try-except etc.)
> debug tools
> review exercise
> File input and output
  > bytefiles
  > elegant close...

Wednesday
> brief review so far
> functions, *args, **kwargs  
  > positional arguments and keyword arguments
> functions live in classes, which live in modules which live in packages
> custom generator and yield
> global and local scope 
> data modelling structures: 
    use built-in structures until they do not suit the purpose (then use classes)
> Objects and Classes (OOP)
> __slots__
> get/set as property decorators @property
> name mangling (__) and slots
> properties, methods, __str__ (dunder)
> intrinsic attributes: __doc__ etc.
- special operators and overriding
> inheritance
> review exercise
- ternary operator
- PEP8 style guide
> Jupyter Notebooks
> use with Django
  - Django is a fully-featured web content-management system
  - use the tutorial (including a full featured admin site)
  - https://docs.djangoproject.com
> http.server for minimal microservices, flask for basic web services, and Django full-fat web!
