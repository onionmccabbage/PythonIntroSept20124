# this is a comment in Python
# Every Python file is a 'module'
# identifiers and basic data types
a = 1 # here is an integer
b = 7.3 # here we have a float
# Python will infer the data type - Python is loosely typed
print(a, type(a), b, type(b))
# we may declare a variable to another value
a = 3.5

# maths
print(a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b)
print(b**a) # ** means raise to the power of
# some other useful mathematical operators
a = 2
b = 7
print(b//a, b%a) # // means modulo division (integer division). % is remainder

# we also have...
c = True # careful True, False, None have initial capital letter
